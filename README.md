OOP with C++ – Unit II: Inheritance 📌 Description

This repository contains C++ programs and practical examples based on Unit II – Inheritance of Object Oriented Programming with C++.

The programs are designed to understand inheritance concepts through simple and real-life examples.

👩‍🎓 Student Details Student Name: Prachi Tayde Course: Object Oriented Programming with C++ Unit: Unit II – Inheritance Year: Second Year Engineering Branch: Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Programming Language: C++ 🎯 Objective

The objective of this unit is to understand how inheritance allows a derived class to reuse and extend the properties and functions of a base class.

📚 Topics Covered

Base Class and Derived Class
Understanding parent and child classes and how a derived class inherits members from a base class.

Protected Members
Understanding the protected access specifier and its use in derived classes.

Relationship Between Base and Derived Class
Understanding the is-a relationship represented by inheritance.

Example:

Animal ↓ Dog

A Dog is an Animal.

Constructor and Destructor in Derived Class
Understanding the execution order of constructors and destructors in inheritance.

Base Constructor ↓ Derived Constructor

Derived Destructor ↓ Base Destructor 5. Overriding Member Functions

Implementing a derived-class version of a function already defined in the base class.

Class Hierarchies
Creating a hierarchy of related classes using inheritance.

Example:

         Vehicle
        /       \
      Car       Bike
Public and Private Inheritance
Understanding:

class Child : public Parent

and

class Child : private Parent

and how they affect accessibility of inherited members.

Types of Inheritance
The major types covered are:

Single Inheritance Multilevel Inheritance Multiple Inheritance Hierarchical Inheritance Hybrid Inheritance 9. Ambiguity in Multiple Inheritance

Understanding ambiguity when two base classes contain members with the same name.

Example:

 A       B
  \     /
    C
If both A and B have the same function, class C may need to specify which function should be called.

Virtual Base Class
Using a virtual base class to avoid duplicate copies of a common base class in multiple/hybrid inheritance.

Abstract Class
Understanding classes containing pure virtual functions that are intended to provide a common interface for derived classes.

Friend Class
Understanding how one class can be declared as a friend of another class and access its private and protected members.

Nested Class
Understanding a class declared inside another class.

💻 Real-Life Applications

Inheritance can be used to model relationships between real-world entities.

🚗 Vehicle Management Vehicle /
Car Bike

Common functionality such as starting a vehicle can be placed in the base class, while specific functionality can be implemented in derived classes.

🏦 Banking System Account /
Savings Current

Common account information can be maintained in the base class, while account-specific operations can be implemented in derived classes.

👨‍💼 Employee Management Employee /
Manager Developer

Common employee information can be inherited, while role-specific functions can be added to derived classes.
